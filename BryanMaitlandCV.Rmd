```

  * Since 2015 I have authored `r NROW(pubs)` papers in peer-reviewed journals on fisheries and conservation topics. 
  * On Google Scholar my h-index is `r bmm_cite$All[2]` with total citations of `r prettyNum(bmm_cite$All[1], big.mark=",")` (as at `r format(Sys.time(), "%e %B %Y")`).
  * I have coauthored `r NROW(bmm_pkgs)` R package as a result of my research. There have been over `r round(sum(bmm_pkgs$downloads, na.rm=TRUE))`  downloads of my packages.
